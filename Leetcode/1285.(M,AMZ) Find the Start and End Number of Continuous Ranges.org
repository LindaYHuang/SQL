Table: Product
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Table: Logs

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| log_id        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID in a log Table.
#+END_EXAMPLE
Since some IDs have been removed from Logs. Write an SQL query to find the start and end number of continuous ranges in table Logs.

Order the result table by start_id.

The query result format is in the following example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Product table:
Logs table:
+------------+
| log_id     |
+------------+
| 1          |
| 2          |
| 3          |
| 7          |
| 8          |
| 10         |
+------------+

Result table:
+------------+--------------+
| start_id   | end_id       |
+------------+--------------+
| 1          | 3            |
| 7          | 8            |
| 10         | 10           |
+------------+--------------+
The result table should contain all ranges in table Logs.
From 1 to 3 is contained in the table.
From 4 to 6 is missing in the table
From 7 to 8 is contained in the table.
Number 9 is missing in the table.
Number 10 is contained in the table.
#+END_EXAMPLE


---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Solution:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
#已验证
SELECT min(log_id) as start_id, max(log_id) as end_id
FROM
(SELECT log_id, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY log_id) as num
FROM Logs) a
GROUP BY log_id - num
#+END_SRC

When you write down the following table, it becomes super easy to understand!
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
log_id, num, difference
1, 1, 0
2, 2, 0
3, 3, 0
7, 4, 3
8, 5, 3
10, 6, 4
#+END_EXAMPLE
