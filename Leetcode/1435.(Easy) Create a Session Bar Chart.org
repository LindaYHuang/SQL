You want to know how long a user visits your application. You decided to create bins of "[0-5>", "[5-10>", "[10-15>" and "15 minutes or more" and count the number of sessions on it.

Write an SQL query to report the (bin, total) in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Sessions table:
+-------------+---------------+
| session_id  | duration      |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 30            |
| 2           | 299           |
| 3           | 340           |
| 4           | 580           |
| 5           | 1000          |
+-------------+---------------+

Result table:
+--------------+--------------+
| bin          | total        |
+--------------+--------------+
| [0-5>        | 3            |
| [5-10>       | 1            |
| [10-15>      | 0            |
| 15 or more   | 1            |
+--------------+--------------+

For session_id 1, 2 and 3 have a duration greater or equal than 0 minutes and less than 5 minutes.
For session_id 4 has a duration greater or equal than 5 minutes and less than 10 minutes.
There are no session with a duration greater or equial than 10 minutes and less than 15 minutes.
For session_id 5 has a duration greater or equal than 15 minutes.
#+END_EXAMPLE
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Solution:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql

SELECT t.bin,count (t.session_id)
 From (Select s.*,
       Case 
        When duration < 300 Then '[0-5>'
        When duration >= 300 and duration < 600 and Then '[5-10>'
        When duration >= 600 and duration < 900 and Then '[10-15>'
        Else '15 or more' as bin
       End
       From Sessions s) as t
 Group by t.bin
#+END_SRC
