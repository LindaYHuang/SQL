There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article (written by some author) on some date. 
Note that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Write an SQL query to find all the people who viewed more than one article on the same date, sorted in ascending order by their id.

The query result format is in the following example:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Views table:
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 3          | 4         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |

SELECT activity_date AS day,
       COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users      
FROM Activity 
WHERE activity_date >= DATE_ADD('2019-07-27',INTERVAL -30 DAY)
GROUP BY user_id
