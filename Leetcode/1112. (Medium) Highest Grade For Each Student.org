1. Get highest grade for each student
2. In case of a tie, choose the course with smaller `course_id`
3. sorted by increasing `student_id`

+------------+-------------------+
| student_id | course_id | grade |
+------------+-----------+-------+
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 2          | 3         | 95    |
