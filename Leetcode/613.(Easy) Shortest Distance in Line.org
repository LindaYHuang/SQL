The shortest distance is '1' obviously, which is from point '-1' to '0'. So the output is as below:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| shortest|
|---------|
| 1       |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note: Every point is unique, which means there is no duplicates in table point.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
select t1.x-t2.x as shortest
from point as t1 join point as t2
where t1.x>t2.x
order by shortest
limit 1
#+END_SRC
