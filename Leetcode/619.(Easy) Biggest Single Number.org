Table number contains many numbers in column num including duplicated ones.
Can you write a SQL query to find the biggest number, which only appears once.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
+---+
|num|
+---+
| 8 |
| 8 |
| 3 |
| 3 |
| 1 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 | 
#+END_EXAMPLE

For the sample data above, your query should return the following result:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
+---+
|num|
+---+
| 6 |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note:
If there is no such number, just output null.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
#解1
# 必须套一个subquery.. 为什么直接SELECT MAX()选不出最大值
SELECT MAX(t.num1) AS num
FROM (SELECT num AS num1
      FROM my_numbers
      GROUP BY num
      HAVING COUNT(num) = 1) t
      
      
#解2
SELECT IFNULL(
	(
		SELECT *
		from my_numbers as M
		group by M.num
		having COUNT(*)=1
		order by M.num desc
		limit 0,1
	)
, NULL) AS num


#+END_SRC
