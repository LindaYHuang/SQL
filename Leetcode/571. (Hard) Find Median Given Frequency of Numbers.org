The Numbers table keeps the value of number and its frequency.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
+----------+-------------+
|  Number  |  Frequency  |
+----------+-------------|
|  0       |  7          |
|  1       |  1          |
|  2       |  3          |
|  3       |  1          |
+----------+-------------+
#+END_EXAMPLE

In this table, the numbers are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, so the median is (0 + 0) / 2 = 0.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
+--------+
| median |
+--------|
| 0.0000 |
+--------+
#+END_EXAMPLE

Write a query to find the median of all numbers and name the result as median.
