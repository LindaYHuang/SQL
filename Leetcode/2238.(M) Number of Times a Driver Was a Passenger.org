Table: Rides
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| ride_id      | int  |
| driver_id    | int  |
| passenger_id | int  |
+--------------+------+
ride_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of the driver and the ID of the passenger that rode in ride_id.
Note that driver_id != passenger_id.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Write an SQL query to report the ID of each driver and the number of times they were a passenger.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Input: 
Rides table:
+---------+-----------+--------------+
| ride_id | driver_id | passenger_id |
+---------+-----------+--------------+
| 1       | 7         | 1            |
| 2       | 7         | 2            |
| 3       | 11        | 1            |
| 4       | 11        | 7            |
| 5       | 11        | 7            |
| 6       | 11        | 3            |
+---------+-----------+--------------+
Output: 
+-----------+-----+
| driver_id | cnt |
+-----------+-----+
| 7         | 2   |
| 11        | 0   |
+-----------+-----+
Explanation: 
There are two drivers in all the given rides: 7 and 11.
The driver with ID = 7 was a passenger two times.
The driver with ID = 11 was never a passenger.

- Solution:
Language: **MySQL**

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT DISTINCT r.driver_id,
ifnull(t.cnt,0) as cnt
FROM Rides r
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT passenger_id, COUNT(*) cnt
    FROM Rides
    GROUP BY passenger_id) t
ON t.passenger_id = r.driver_id
#+END_SRC
