Given a table tree, id is identifier of the tree node and p_id is its parent node's id.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
| 2  | 1    |
| 3  | 1    |
| 4  | 2    |
| 5  | 2    |
+----+------+
#+END_EXAMPLE
Each node in the tree can be one of three types:
Leaf: if the node is a leaf node.
Root: if the node is the root of the tree.
Inner: If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.
 

Write a query to print the node id and the type of the node. Sort your output by the node id. The result for the above sample is:
 
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
+----+------+
| id | Type |
+----+------+
| 1  | Root |
| 2  | Inner|
| 3  | Leaf |
| 4  | Leaf |
| 5  | Leaf |
+----+------+
#+END_EXAMPLE




#+BEGIN_SRC SQL
SELECT id,
       CASE WHEN p_id is NULL THEN 'root'
            WHEN id IN (SELECT p_id FROM tree) THEN 'inner'
            ELSE 'leaf'
       END AS Type
FROM tree
ORDER BY id
#+END_SRC
