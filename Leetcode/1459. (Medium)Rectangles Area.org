SQL Schema
Table: Points
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| x_value       | int     |
| y_value       | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
Each point is represented as a 2D Dimensional (x_value, y_value).
#+END_EXAMPLE
Write an SQL query to report of all possible rectangles which can be formed by any two points of the table. 

Each row in the result contains three columns (p1, p2, area) where:

p1 and p2 are the id of two opposite corners of a rectangle and p1 < p2.
Area of this rectangle is represented by the column area.
Report the query in descending order by area in case of tie in ascending order by p1 and p2.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Points table:
+----------+-------------+-------------+
| id       | x_value     | y_value     |
+----------+-------------+-------------+
| 1        | 2           | 8           |
| 2        | 4           | 7           |
| 3        | 2           | 10          |
+----------+-------------+-------------+

Result table:
+----------+-------------+-------------+
| p1       | p2          | area        |
+----------+-------------+-------------+
| 2        | 3           | 6           |
| 1        | 2           | 2           |
+----------+-------------+-------------+

p1 should be less than p2 and area greater than 0.
p1 = 1 and p2 = 2, has an area equal to |2-4| * |8-7| = 2.
p1 = 2 and p2 = 3, has an area equal to |4-2| * |7-10| = 2.
p1 = 1 and p2 = 3 It's not possible because has an area equal to 0.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
SELECT actor_id,director_id
FROM ActorDirector
GROUP BY actor_id,director_id
HAVING COUNT(timestamp) >=3
