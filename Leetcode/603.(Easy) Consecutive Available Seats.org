Several friends at a cinema ticket office would like to reserve consecutive available seats.
Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat_id using the following cinema table?
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| seat_id | free |
|---------|------|
| 1       | 1    |
| 2       | 0    |
| 3       | 1    |
| 4       | 1    |
| 5       | 1    |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Your query should return the following result for the sample case above.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| seat_id |
|---------|
| 3       |
| 4       |
| 5       |
#+END_EXAMPLE

-SOLUTION
#+BEGIN_SRC SQL
# use self join for this relative complex problem.
SELECT c1.seat_id
FROM cinema c1 JOIN cinema c2
WHERE c1.free = TRUE AND c2.free = TRUE
      AND ABS(c1.seat_id - c2.seat_id) = 1 #前座和后座
ORDER BY c1.seat_id
#+END_SRC
