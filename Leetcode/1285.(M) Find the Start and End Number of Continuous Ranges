Table: Product
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Table: Logs

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| log_id        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID in a log Table.
#+END_EXAMPLE
Since some IDs have been removed from Logs. Write an SQL query to find the start and end number of continuous ranges in table Logs.

Order the result table by start_id.

The query result format is in the following example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Product table:
Logs table:
+------------+
| log_id     |
+------------+
| 1          |
| 2          |
| 3          |
| 7          |
| 8          |
| 10         |
+------------+

Result table:
+------------+--------------+
| start_id   | end_id       |
+------------+--------------+
| 1          | 3            |
| 7          | 8            |
| 10         | 10           |
+------------+--------------+
The result table should contain all ranges in table Logs.
From 1 to 3 is contained in the table.
From 4 to 6 is missing in the table
From 7 to 8 is contained in the table.
Number 9 is missing in the table.
Number 10 is contained in the table.

- Solution:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
SELECT seller_id
FROM sales
GROUP BY seller_id
HAVING SUM(price) = (   #此处解决 MORE THAN 1 /TIE 的 情况）
    SELECT SUM(price) 
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY seller_id
    ORDER BY SUM(price) desc
    LIMIT 1)
#+END_SRC
