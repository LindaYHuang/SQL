Write an SQL query for a report that provides the customer ids from the Customer table that bought all the products in the Product table.

For example:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Customer table:
+-------------+-------------+
| customer_id | product_key |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 5           |
| 2           | 6           |
| 3           | 5           |
| 3           | 6           |
| 1           | 6           |
+-------------+-------------+

Product table:
+-------------+
| product_key |
+-------------+
| 5           |
| 6           |
+-------------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| customer_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
The customers who bought all the products (5 and 6) are customers with id 1 and 3.
#+END_EXAMPLE


---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Solution:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
SELECT customer_id
FROM Customer c 
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT c.product_key)  = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Product) 
#+END_SRC
